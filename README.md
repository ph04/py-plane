# py-plane
A script able to return information about curves on cartesian planes.

`plane.py` is able to return information about Triangles, Parabolas and Circumferences on a cartesian plane, given the needed information about that specific figure. Run the script on your console.

`curve.py` returns the defined Parabola and Circumference by the given 3 points. Run the script on your console. If _division by zero error_ is raised, one of the two curves does not exist.

`system.py` contains classes for 3x3 Linear Systems and for 3x3 Matrices; it solves 3x3 Linear Systems with the Cramer's rule and calculates the determinant of the 3x3 Matrices with the Sarrus' rule.
